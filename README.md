# p5.js Chaos Simulation

This is a simulation of two balls bouncing within a large circle. The balls are 0.001 units shifted in the x axis. When they drop they initially follow the same trajectory however they can be seen to slowly diverge demonstrating chaos theory and how small perterbations in the input can result in large changes in the output.
